# Github Readme Blog Post Action

A (somewhat) simple github action that generates a set of cards for recent blog posts.

Here's an example of how it looks given the URLs for DEV Community, JavaScript Weekly, and Echo JS:

<!-- blog-post-list:start -->
<!-- blog-post-list:end -->

> Docs in progress
